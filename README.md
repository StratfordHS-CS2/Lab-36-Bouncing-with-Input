# Lab 36 - Bouncing with Input

Copy and paste your code from `Lab 35 - Bouncing Ball` into `main.py`.  You will be modifying this code to add functionality.

1. Add a second bouncing ball (or more).  This can be either an image or a drawn shape.
2. When the ball is clicked it should change direction and/or speed.
3. When the spacebar (`K_SPACE`) is pressed something should happen with the behavior of all of the balls.  Examples: all of the colors change, all of the directions change, the sizes change, etc.
